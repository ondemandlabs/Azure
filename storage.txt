Azure storage
-------------

Blob ----> object storage

File ----- _ Files shares for cloud and on-prem deployments

Queues ----- > Will discuss in detail in messaging section

Azure Blob storage
------------------

1) Object storage Blob -----> (Binary large objects)

2) Great for files, videos, documents, large files etc.

3) Up to 4.777 TB per file, 190 TB per preview

4) Extremely cost effective

5) Maasively scalable

6) Great availability options

7) Extremely easy to use

8) usually used in conjection with SQL, MYSQL Database

Security
--------

1) IP firewall rules
2)Service End points
3)private end points
4) Shared access signature
5)Access keys and Azure Active Directory Authentication
6) Secure Communication
7) Data encrypted by default


Azure storage rdundant
-------------------------

1)LRS ----> Locally redundant storage
2)ZRS ------> Zone redundant storage
3)GRS -------> Geo redundant storage 

Locally redundant storage
-------------------------
LRS replicates your storage account three times within a single data centre in the primary region. LRS provides at least 99.99999999%

LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failure, LRs may be lost or uncoverabls if entire data centre fails

If your application stores data that can be easily restricted to replicate data only within a country

Zone-redundant storage
------------------------
Zone redundant storage replicates your storage account across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.

Each availability zones is a separated physicall location with independent power. ZRS offers durability for storage resource of at least 99.99999999999% over a given year.

With ZRS, your data is still accessible for both read and write operations even if a zone becomes unavilable

Microsoft recommends using zrs in the primary region for scenarios that require high availability.


GRS(Geo redundant storage)
---------------------------
Geo- redundant storage copies your data three times with a single physical location in the primary region using LRS, it then copies your data to physical location in a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region

GRS offers durability for storage resources of at least 99.999999999999%

A write operation is first committed to the primary location and replicated using LRS
 
GEO_Redundant storage combines high availability of your data and provided using the availability zones
